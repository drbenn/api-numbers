# api-numbers
Number Facts API
Created first API web interface using http://numbersapi.com/. However, after completing and uploading to Github to present on 
Github pages, learned about mixed content. Lesson learned. Apparently, mixed content, fetching from HTTP(which is provided on 
the numbers api), is no longer allowed on git and through browswer - other than on local machine.

So although api-numbers works on my local machine, as the Number Facts API uses http not https, it does not work on Github pages.

Fantastic
